# SurfsUp_Challenge

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if it is smart for W.Avy to open an ice cream and surf shop in Oahu. He wants it to be profitable year round and needs information to prove whether it is a good decision. The specific months that he is asking for data from are June and December. 


**Outcome"**
Based on the data for the months of June and December-there is a lot of potential for the surf and ice cream shop in Oahu. 

The average temp for June is 74 degrees and the average temp is 71 degrees in December. Personally, those are ideal ice cream eating temperatures- perhaps I am little biased living in Wisconsin where average temperature in December is below 32 degrees.

Even the low temperatures are not too bad. Could potentially lose out on some ice cream sales in December when it's only in the 50's, but that could still be good surfing weather since the water may even be warmer than the air temp.
